# C++ Projects

## Note
This project was created on Mac but compiled for Windows. If the .exe files don't work, please compile & run the .cpp files.

## Overview
This is the main folder for all of the C++ ICS challenges. Run multitudes of different programs from a simple name repeater all the way to an object item search and an encrypted login project. 

## How To Run
To run the programs, simply clone this repo and launch the [Menu exe](https://github.com/m-mitrovic/CPP-Projects/blob/main/Menu). If the exe doesn't launch, please compile & run the .cpp file [Menu.cpp](https://github.com/m-mitrovic/CPP-Projects/blob/main/Menu.cpp). Each project has detailed comments in the code explaining how the approach I took to completing each challenge. I hope you enjoy!

## What Have I Learned
As I progressed with each program I boosted my understanding of how C++ works. I learned how to create C++ classes, object arrays, loop through different values, encrypt text & securely store it, along with passing values to functions and return values. In addition, I also learned how to better structure my code so that it is reusable and easily debugable.

### Completed May 21, 2021 - Created by Mihajlo M. for ICS 4U
